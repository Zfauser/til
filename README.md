## About

I have for a long time maintained notes in a public wiki, finding the TIL of 
Josh Branchaud [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) was an eye-opener and I immiediately wanted to try it out, so after a few months I have finally set it up.

I plan to migrate my earlier notes, so they are more easily accessible here as TIL snippets, this will be done when I have the time, one TIL at a time :-)
