# Use cpanm

`cpanm` or **App::cpanminus** is a magnificent Perl tool for installing CPAN distributions (or your own distributions).

```bash
$ cpan App::cpanminus
```

If you want to keep a clean install, consider using **local::lib**

If you are [using perlbrew](../perlbrew/install_perlbrew.md) you get cpanm installed with `perlbrew`.

The author of App::cpanminus, Miyagawa, also made [an introduction video](http://weblog.bulknews.net/post/44086130029/introducing-cpanm-1-6-by-miyagawa).
