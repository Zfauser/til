# Use exa

`exa` is an alternative to `ls`.

One of it's features is show icons on the command line.

This does however require a font that supports this, like **Nerd** (see [this issue][fontissue]).

On MacOS you can do the following:

```bash
$ brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
$ brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
```

And the pick the font in your terminal application.
