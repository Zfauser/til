# use git-delta

**git-delta** primarily known as **delta** (not to be confused with the other **delta**, [a tool to inspect files with code][tigris]), is alternative _diff pager_ for **Git** (`git`), like the popular **diff-so-fancy**.

I discovered `delta` from [a dev.to post by Mahmoud Ashraf][dev.to], entitled "My terminal became more Rusty ðŸ¦€".

**Rust**  utilities are generally very fast so I though I would give it a _spin_, but I go so much more than speed and `delta` can do quite a bit:

- language syntax highlighting
- within-line insertion/deletion detection
- multiple insertion/deletions detected per line
- matching of unequal numbers of changed lines
- independently stylable elements
- line numbering
- side-by-side view

The above list is copied from the [delta documentation][github].

I `.gitconfig` has been updated to use `delta`, it can be found in my [dotfiles repository][dotfiles].
