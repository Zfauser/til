# List merged branches

Listing branches is basic

```bash
$ git branch
```

Listing branches that have been merged

```bash
$ git branch --merged
```

Listing branches that have been merged on your remote: 

```bash
$ git branch -r --merged
```

Hence listing all branches on the remote:

```bash
$ git branch -r
```
