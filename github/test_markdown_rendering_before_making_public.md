# Test Markdown rendering before making public

When working with Markdown on Github (Github flavoured markdown), I do often not see the rendered version until it is pushed to the repository. This mean that sometimes basic errors make their way and I have to make additional commits to README files etc.

You could of course use a branch!

Or! You create a **gist** of your Markdown file, you can actually even keep the **gist** private, the _only_ drawback is images cannot be rendered if they are to follow the change going into the repository.
