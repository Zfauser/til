# Use CLI

GitHub has release [an official command line tool](https://cli.github.com/) _in beta_, limited in functionality is looks promising.

Is does however not replace `hub` yet.

Unfortunately the GitHub CLI client `gh` clashes with [the Ruby tool](https://rubygems.org/gems/gh) of the same name.
