# Use emojis

You can use a lot of different emojis on GitHub :astonished:

This mean you can communicate using small icons :lollipop: :ok_hand:

It does work in [GitHub Wikis](https://github.com/jonasbn/til/wiki), but it
does not necessarily render correctly if you are using GitHub pages.

See [this example](http://jonasbn.github.io/til/github/use_emojis.html), which is the HTML rendering of this page, which is written in Markdown.
