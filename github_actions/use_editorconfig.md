# Use EditorConfig

There are several implementations I currently use: **editorconfig-checker/action-editorconfig-checker**

The GitHub Action uses `ec` (**editorconfig-checker**) an alternative to `eclint`, it is currently actively maintained, whereas `eclint` has been archived and is not longer actively maintained, it is probably still very usefull, but at some point an actively developed project might be of more value.
