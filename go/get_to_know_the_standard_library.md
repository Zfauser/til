# Get to know the standard library

Many Go resources and people recommend using the standard over 3rd. party external dependencies.

I believe it is a good idea to evaluate the options in the standard library before just starting to use the most _spiffy and shiny_.

A nice over view of the standard library is [available here][STDLIB].

This is an interesting additional read serving as [a walkthrough][WALK].

Since I am still learning Go, I will add notes on the standard library here as I accumulate pick up some more experience.
