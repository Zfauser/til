# Use Triggers

I fell over [this very short piece on triggers](https://dev.to/atfzl/using-iterm-triggers-1h93) in **iTerm**

> iTerm triggers can be used for converting text in your terminal to URLs and make them clickable. This is useful for creating JIRA issue links whenever there is a JIRA-1234 like pattern.

Go to iTerm -> `Preferences` -> `Profiles` -> `Advanced` -> `Triggers Edit``

Check [the official documentation](https://iterm2.com/documentation-triggers.html) for some insights

For now I have created triggers for my project directories so they change the title when I enter and leave.

The author of the piece I first mentioned, does neat trick with Jira issues. I do however not work with Jira in my **iTerm**, but the concept is neat and resembles what I do with a shortcut in my browser.
