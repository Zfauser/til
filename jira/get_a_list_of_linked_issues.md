# Get a List of Linked Issues

When you are trying to interconnect and assemble a set of issues (_bugs, tasks, stories_) it can be hard to gather them for bulk operations, like assigning them to the same _EPIC_ or similar.

Well in **Jira's** issue search field you can provide the following query:

```
issue in linkedIssues(issueKey)
```

This will give you a result listing all of the issues linked to the `Ã¬ssueKey` you provide.

In addition you can, do the following to refine the query, by providing an additional `linkType`, like so:

```
issue in linkedIssues(issueKey,linkType)
```
