# Set Keyboard Layout

When you boot using **Kali Linux** live USB, you might need to change the keyboard to map to your physical keyboard - I know I do.

1. Go to the Kali Linux 'Settings'
2. Type 'keyboard'
3. Click 'Layout'
4. Pick a keyboard that matches your physical keyboard

If the change does not take effect, try to turn on and off the 'Use system defaults'.
