Bookmarks being saved on Desktop
I have often been bitten by the annoyance of Opera saving a bookmarks file to my Desktop.
To change the location of where your bookmarks are saved, please do the following:
Open 'About Opera' in the menu under 'Opera' here you will be able to see where your bookmarks file is being saved
You can also see where the operaprefs.ini file is being kept
Open the operaprefs.ini and locate the string 'Hot List File' this should point to your bookmars file, change the path and restart Opera 

No migration
Please note that the above tip does not take into consideration that you might want to migrate your bookmarks, you will have to import this afterwards
