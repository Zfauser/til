# Mac Keyboard Symbols

Writing keyboard symbols can be extremely useful and it is nice to be able to write out symbols like: **⌃⌥⇧⌘Q**.

| Sym | Key         | Alt |
|:---:|:------------|:---:|
|  ⌃  | Control     |     |
|  ⌥  | Option      |     |
|  ⇧  | Shift       |     |
|  ⌘  | Command     |    |

A complete list is available in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Zenexer/c5243c4216f1f8cd2251).

And you can _copy-paste_ (⌃-c, ⌃-v) from this list or some other resource.

OR...

This nifty trick, where you define shortcuts for all of the necessary symbols.

Go into 'System Preferences', pick 'Keyboard' and then 'Text'.

Define the shortcuts you need. I use the convention `<shortcut>` and then replaces with the appropriate symbol.

`<cmd>` becomes `⌘` and so forth.
