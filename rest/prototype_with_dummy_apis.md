# Prototype with dummy APIs

For getting going with example/dummy APIs [the Req  Res service][regres.in] is awesome.

It offers a RESTful interface support the verbs:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `PUT`

And variations in URIs so you can simulate different aspects of an application, such as listing, non-found resources, unsuccessfull requests etc.
