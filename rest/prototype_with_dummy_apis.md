# Prototype with dummy APIs

For getting going with example/dummy APIs [the Req  Res service][reqres] is awesome.

It offers a RESTful interface support the verbs:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `PUT`

And variations in URIs so you can simulate different aspects of an application, such as listing, non-found resources, unsuccessfull requests etc.

Another interesting alternative is: [JSONPlaceholder][jsonplaceholder].

## Resources

- [Req  Res][reqres]
- [JSONPlaceholder][jsonplaceholder]

[reqres]: https://reqres.in/
[jsonplaceholder]: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
