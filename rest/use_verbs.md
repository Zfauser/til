# Use Verbs

Use the verbs specified for the HTTP protocol to get the most our of you HTTP based API.

- `POST` for creation
- `GET` for reading
- `PUT` for updating or replacing
- `PATCH` for updating or modifying
- `DELETE` for deletion

If you, _like me_ cannot remember, which of the verbs does what, like `POST` and `PUT` you can use this simple rules of thumb, the first one I got from a colleague

> The `U` in `PUT` is for update

And now for one I had to make for myself.

> Post is always delivered at the gate, so when thinking about `POST`, remember gate rhymes with create
