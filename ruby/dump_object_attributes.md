# Dump objects attributes

You can dump a objects attributes using `Ã¬nspect` and you can even extend it.

```ruby
puts variable.inspect
```

Do note that this works for _all_ data types, not just objects. And there is even an alternative do see [`pp`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.2.0/PP.html).

```ruby
pp variable
```
