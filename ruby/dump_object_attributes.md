# Dump objects attributes

You can dump a objects attributes using `Ã¬nspect` and you can even extend it.

> Adding an inspect method to your class allows you to define how the class' attributes are
> displayed, rather than rely on default output. A lot of classes don't implement it well, but it
> can be really useful when debugging. Ruby will fall back to to_s if it can't find an inspect`
> method

```ruby
puts variable.inspect
```
