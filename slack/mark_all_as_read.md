# Mark all as read

Power tip by @rjbs via Twitter: `<shift>`-`<esc>`

> Shift-Esc marks all messages in every channel in Slack as read, and you should learn to use it whenever you feel overwhelmed.

Thanks @RJBS

- Do note it is per Slack, so you might have to repeat
- It will warn, but use with caution in the begining, because you could loose track of things
