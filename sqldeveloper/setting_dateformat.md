# Setting the date format

The reason why I wrote this _til_ is because it took me some time to hunt down and I might forget how to do it.

1. From Oracle SQL Developer's menu go to: Tools > Preferences.
2. From the Preferences dialog, select Database > NLS from the left panel.
3- From the list of NLS parameters, enter DD-MON-RR HH24:MI:SS into the Date Format field.
4. Save and close the dialog, done!
