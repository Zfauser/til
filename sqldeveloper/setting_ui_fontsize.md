# Setting UI fontsize

Via the regular preferences you are able to control the fontsize for the editor window, but the rest of the UI might be somewhat _clunky_.

You can manually edit the `ide.properties` file located deep in `$HOME/.sqldeveloper` folder (path depends on version). Please note you might have several.

Comment in the `Ide.FontSize` and set the size.

Got the solution from an [Ubuntu hint](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1174026).

Found a [Windows equivalent](http://www.thatjeffsmith.com/archive/2013/12/how-to-change-the-ui-font-size-for-oracle-sql-developer/) Googling.
