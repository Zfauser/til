# View Compilation Log

When you compile **PL/SQL** in **SQL Developer**, it often come handy to see the compilation log in case of error. **SQL Developer** emits the following message:

```
Errors: check compiler log
```

Either you can go into the menu: `View` > `Log` or you can press: `<ctrl>-<cmd>-L` (on a Mac).
