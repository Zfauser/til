# View Twitter Bookmarks on Desktop

The Twitter bookmarks feautre is only available on the mobile clients and not on the desktop (web).

Well luckily there is an easy way to view and work with your bookmarks, which is not on your mobile client.

Simply go to: https://mobile.twitter.com/i/bookmarks in a webbrowser where you are logged into your Twitter account.
