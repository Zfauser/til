# View Twitter Bookmarks on Desktop

Do note that this nifty trick is no longer necessary, since bookmarks have are now supported in Desktop browsers as well.

The Twitter bookmarks feautre is only available on the mobile clients and not on the desktop (web).

Well luckily there is an easy way to view and work with your bookmarks, which is not on your mobile client.

Simply go to: https://mobile.twitter.com/i/bookmarks in a webbrowser where you are logged into your Twitter account.
